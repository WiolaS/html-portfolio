<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Wioleta Sobczyk</h2>
<p>Currently: <em>Account payable specialist</em></p>
<p>Soon: <strong>Web Developer</strong></p>

<p>
  In my current position, I process daily operations of the AP department
  related to payments and take care of their timeliness. I process external
  payments according to the payment calendar, urgent payments and manual
  payments. I handle and analyze refunded or rejected payments. I handle payment
  enquiries from internal and external partners, as well as support internal
  control audits and prepare relevant documentation. I work with local business
  and other departments to ensure timely payments.
</p>

<p>
  I would like to change my profession. I have been learning how to create a
  website. Recently, I have been learning this in Udemy’s Web Development
  Course. I knew about this course thanks to the support from the Project
  "Przyszły Programista".
